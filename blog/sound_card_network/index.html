    <p>A story about my first non-trivial debugging experience.</p>

<p>A <em>‘fake it 'till you make it’</em> attitude led me to a job as a <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/">Site Reliability
Engineer</a> at Google Dublin. On 2018-11-05 I started as a Software
Developer on a team responsible for the Google search frontend (you might have
seen <a href="https://www.google.com">the website</a> before). It is hard to <em>fake it</em> when you are
responsible for the website that people routinely use to check if their internet
connection works.</p>

<p>To feel better about my experience and skill I am going back to the first
incident where more than a simple search was needed to solve my problems. The
year was 2012, I was still in high school, and was rocking an Ubuntu 12.04
laptop.</p>

<h1 id="what-were-the-first-symptoms-of-the-incident">What were the first symptoms of the incident</h1>

<p>I just started my computer and was browsing the web for a short while when the
internet went down. Every request either failed or never finished. I was in the
dark. Checked the WiFi on my phone: the same. Asked my brother and he also
confirmed that everything just stopped.</p>

<h1 id="testing-the-obvious-problems">Testing the obvious problems</h1>

<p>Without a though I went to our router, plugged it out the wall, waited a couple
of seconds and plugged it back in. Thinking from experience I was fairly
confident that this will solve any network problem.</p>

<p>I go back to my computer, wait for it to reconnect and voilà! The internet
worked… for around 10 seconds and then everything started failing same as
before. I guessed the ISP is to blame so I closed my laptop and went away while
I waited for the problems to blow over.</p>

<p>After a while I used my phone to check if the internet is working. To my
surprise everything worked fine for quite some time. But as soon as I got back
on my laptop the problems <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o85xKfKHgdPsdDH44/giphy.gif">returned</a> like an exam you keep failing
but never study for.</p>

<h1 id="when-blaming-others-does-not-work-blame-yourself">When blaming others does not work, blame yourself</h1>

<p>I finally accepted that my computer might be to blame for the outages our
household experienced. I disconnected my computer from the network and sure
enough everything went back to normal.</p>

<p>This realization left me Googling on my phone and trying multiple generic fixes,
all of which I had to copy by hand and none of them worked. Damn. It was time to
take things seriously. I want to see what exactly happens on my computer when it
connects.</p>

<h1 id="lets-sniff-some-packets">Let’s sniff some packets</h1>

<p>I fire up WireShark and connect. After a couple of seconds a ton of identical
requests floods my screen. All of them multicast, all of them headed to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">224.0.0.56</code>.</p>

<p>It became clear that this is the cause of the problems. I was sending so much
hidden network traffic that our cheap router could not handle any more requests.
But where Exactly was I sending it?</p>

<p>Googling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">224.0.0.56</code> produced a single result. It was a <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/411688">bug report for
pulseaudio</a> flooding the network with multicast packets. Knowing that
I’m not alone made me feel reassured.</p>

<p>The issue was that with certain configurations the service I used to stream
audio to a remote speaker lost all decency and self-control which resulted in
endless data streams on your network.  One workaround for the issue was to
continuously kill the self-restarting pulseaudio</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>while true; do killall pulseaudio; sleep 1; done
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Beautiful. I opted for the more sane approach and simply disabled network audio
streaming.</p>

<h1 id="post-mortem-aka-tldr">Post mortem (aka TLDR)</h1>

<p>A faulty pulse audio (multicast/RDP) service flooded my network with UDP
requests which effectively caused a denial-of-service attack on our home router.</p>

<p>Two possible improvements that would help with dealing the same problem:</p>
<ul>
  <li>get a better router so that medium amounts of traffic are not fatal,</li>
  <li>have readily available stats on network usage so the problem can be detected sooner.</li>
</ul>
