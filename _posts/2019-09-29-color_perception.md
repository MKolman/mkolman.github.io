Light

# Light

Electromagnetic spectrum is vast and diverse. From Hulk-creating gamma rays,
every student's best friend - microwaves,  X-rays for the broken, all the way to
radio waves bringing horrible ads to your car's stereo.

There is a special subset of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths between
400nm and 700nm that we call visible light. Unless (color)blind, you have
specialized cells in your eyes that let you distinguish between different
wavelengths of visible light which you perceive as colour.

But we rarely deal with light consisting of a single wavelength. Unless staring
into a laser or a single coloured LED, our eyes will be subject to a wide
spectrum of wavelengths at all times. Receptors in our eyes process that signal
and send it to the brain to interpret a colour.
