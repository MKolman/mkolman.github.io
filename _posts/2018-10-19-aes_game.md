Is there a way to store private information publicly on GitHub? The data we
upload must be perfectly retrievable for us and only us.

# Advanced Encryption Standard

The answer might lie with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) which provides a
symmetric encryption for any binary stream.

# Programming challenge
Here are a series of tasks. Each input is encrypted with [encrypt.sh]({{"assets/aes_game/encrypt.sh"}})

{% highlight shell %}
openssl-1.0 aes-256-cbc -in <inFname> -out <outFname> -k <encKey> -base64
{% endhighlight %}
To decrypt a file just add a `-d` flag to the end of the command.

The first task is enctypted with a two character key. Find it and you can start!

| Task | Encrypted input | input | solution |
| 01_run_me.py   | [download][down01] | [decrypt][down01]{:.decrypt download="01_run_me.py"} | [decrypt][sol01]{:.decrypt download="01_run_me_solution.py"} |



[down01]: {{"/assets/aes_game/01_run_me.py.aes"|relative_path}}
[sol01]: {{"/assets/aes_game/01_run_me_solution.py.aes"|relative_path}}
